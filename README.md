</div>

**m8flow** is an open-source workflow engine implemented in pure Python.  
It is built on the proven foundation of SpiffWorkflow, with a vision shaped by **8 guiding principles** for flow orchestration:

**Merge flows effectively** – streamline complex workflows  
**Make apps faster** – speed up development and deployment  
**Manage processes better** – bring structure and clarity to execution  
**Minimize errors** – reduce mistakes through automation  
**Maximize efficiency** – get more done with fewer resources  
**Model workflows visually** – design with simplicity and clarity  
**Modernize systems** – upgrade legacy processes seamlessly  
**Mobilize innovation** – empower teams to build and experiment quickly

## Why m8flow?

**Future-proof alternative** → replaces Camunda 7 with a modern, Python-based workflow engine  
**Enterprise-grade integrations** → tight alignment with **formsflow.ai**, **caseflow**, and the **SLED360** automation suite  
**Open and extensible** → open source by default, extensible for enterprise-grade use cases  
**Principles-first branding** → “m8” = 8 principles for flow, consistent with the product family (caseflow, formsflow.ai)  
**Visual and symbolic meaning**:  
  - “8 nodes” in automation  
  - “8” resembles a curled Python → Python-native identity  
  - “m8” → mate / mighty → collaboration and strength

## Features

**BPMN 2.0**: pools, lanes, multi-instance tasks, sub-processes, timers, signals, messages, boundary events, loops  
**DMN**: baseline implementation integrated with the Python execution engine  
**Forms support**: extract form definitions (Camunda XML extensions → JSON) for CLI or web UI generation  
**Python-native workflows**: run workflows via Python code or JSON structures  
**Integration-ready**: designed to plug into formsflow, caseflow, decision engines, and enterprise observability tools  

_A complete list of the latest features is available in our [release notes](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/m8flow/releases)._
